\section{2D Unsteady Uniform Property: Convecting Decaying Taylor Vortex}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Verification of first-order and second-order temporal accuracy for the
CVFEM and EBVC formulation in Nalu is performed using the method of manufactured 
solution (MMS) technique. For the unsteady isothermal, uniform laminar physics set,
the exact solution of the convecting, decaying Taylor vortex is used.

\begin{equation}
  u = u_o - cos(\pi(x-u_ot)) sin(\pi(y-v_ot))e^{-2.0\omega t}
\label{advConvTV_u}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  v = v_o + sin(\pi(x-u_ot)) cos(\pi(y-v_ot))e^{-2.0\omega t} 
\label{advConvTV_v}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  p = -\frac{p_o}{4}(cos(2\pi(x-u_ot)) + cos(2\pi(y-v_ot)))e^{-4\omega t}
\label{advConvTV_p}
\end{equation}

In this study, the constants $u_o$, $v_o$, and $p_o$ are all assigned values of $1.0$,
and the viscosity $\mu$ is set to a
constant value of $0.001$. The value of $\omega$ is $\pi^2\mu$. This particular viscosity value 
results in a maximum cell reynolds number of twenty.  

\subsection{Temporal Order Of Accuracy Results}
The temporal order of accuracy for the first order backward Euler and second order BDF2
are outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:fo4thTstep} and Figure~\ref{fig:fo4thTstep}. Each of these
simulations used a hybrid factor of zero to ensure pure second order central usage. A
fixed Courant number of two was used for each of the three meshes (100x100, 200x200 and 400x400).
The simulation was run out to 0.2 seconds and L2 error norms were computed. The standard
fourth order pressure stabilization scheme with time step scaling is used. This scheme is also
known as the standard pressure-free approximate pressure projection scheme.

Two other pressure projection schemes have been evaluated in this study. Each represent a 
simplification of the standard pressure projection scheme. Figure~\ref{fig:hybridTstep} outlines
two projection schemes: the first is when the projected nodal gradinet is lagged and the 
second is the classic pressure-free pressure approximate projection scheme with second
order pressure stabilization. The error plots demonstrate that lagging the projected nodal
gradient for pressure retains second order accuracy. However, as expected the pressure
free pressure projection scheme is confirmed to be first order accurate.

The Steady Taylor Vortex will be used to verify the spatial accuracy for the full set of advection
operators supported in Nalu.

\section{Higher Order 2D Steady Uniform Property: Taylor Vortex}

A higher order unstructured CVFEM method has been developed by Domino~\cite{Domino:2014}. 
A 2D structured mesh study demonstrating second order time and third order in space scheme 
has been demonstrated. The below work has emphasis on unstructured meshes.

\subsection{Source Term Quadrature}
Higher order accuracy is only demonstrated on solutions with source terms when a fully integrated
approach is used. Lumping the source term evaluation is a second order error and is fully noted in
the MMS study )not shown).

\subsection{Projected nodal gradients}
Results show that one must use design order projected nodal gradients. Figure~\ref{fig:pngTempMMS} demonstrates 
a code verification result for a steady thermal manufactured solution comparing lumped and consistent mass
matrix approaches for the projected nodal gradient on a tquad mesh. In the lumped approach, a simple 
explicit algorithm is processed while for the consistent approach, a simple mass matrix inversion equation 
must be solved. The lumped approach is first order while the consistent approach retains second order. Both
Dirichlet and periodic domains display the same order of convergence.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Momentum and Pressure}
The steady taylor vortex exact solution was run on a tquad mesh. Figure~\ref{fig:hoSTVMMS} demonstrates 
the order of accuracy for projected nodal gradients (pressure) and the velocity field (x-component). 
Second order accuracy for the projected nodal gradient (pressure) and third order for the velocity field
is realized when the consistent mass matrix approach is used for the projected nodal pressure gradient. 
Note that this term is used in the pressure stabilization approach. However, order of convergence for 
the projected nodal pressure gradient and velocity field is compromised when the lumped mass matrix approach
is used for the pressure stabilization term. Note that both approaches use the fully integrated pressure
gradient term in the momentum equation (i.e., $\int p n_i dS$). Therefore, the reduced order of integration
for the projected nodal pressure gradient has consequence on the velocity field order of convergence.
 
Again, dirichlet (inflow) and periodic domains display the same order of convergence.

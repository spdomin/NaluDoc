An alternative to classic Peclet number blending is the usage of a discontinuity capturing operator (DCO).
In this method, an artifical viscosity is defined that is a function of the local residual and scaled computational 
gradients. Viable usages for the DCO can be advection/diffusion problems in addition to the aforementioned RTE
VMS approach.

The formal finite element kernel for a DCO approach is as follows,
\begin{equation}
  \sum_e \int_\Omega \nu(\mathbf{R}) \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_i} g^{ij} \frac{\partial \phi} {\partial x_j} d\Omega,
\label{dcoFEMForm}
\end{equation}
where $\nu(\mathbf{R})$ is the artifical viscosity which is a function of the pde fine-scale residual and $g^{ij}$ is the covariant
metric tensor.

For completeness, the covariant and contravarient metric tensor is given by,
\begin{equation}
  g^{ij} = \frac{\partial x_i} {\partial \xi_k}\frac{\partial x_j} {\partial \xi_k},
\label{coVariant}
\end{equation}

 and

\begin{equation}
  g_{ij} = \frac{\partial \xi_k} {\partial x_i} \frac{\partial \xi_k} {\partial x_i}
\label{coVariant}
\end{equation}

where $\xi = (\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3)^T$.

The form of $\nu(\mathbf{R})$ currently used is as follows,
\begin{equation}
  \nu = \sqrt{ \frac{\mathbf{R_k} \mathbf{R_k}} {\frac {\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} g^{ij} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_j}} }.
\label{nuOne}
\end{equation}

A residual for a classic advection/diffusion/source pde is simply the fine scale residual computed at the gauss point,
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{\hat R} = \frac{\partial \rho \phi}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (\rho u_j \phi - \mu^{eff} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_j}) -S
 \label{dcoResidual}
\end{equation}
Note that the above equation requires a second derivative whose source is the diffusion term. The first derivative is generally determined
by using projected nodal gradients. As will be noted in the pressure stabilization section, the advection term carries the pressure
stabilization terms. However, in the above equation, these terms are not explicity noted. Therefore, we subtract the fine scale continuity
equation to obtain the final general form of the source term,
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{R} = \mathbf{\hat R} -  (\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho u_j }{\partial x_j}).
 \label{dcoResidual}
\end{equation}

Using a piecewise-constant test function suitable for CVFEM and EBVC schemes (the reader is refered to the VMS RTE section), 
Eq.~\ref{dcoFEMForm} can be written as,
\begin{equation}
  -\sum_e \int_\Gamma \nu(\mathbf{R}) g^{ij} \frac{\partial \phi} {\partial x_j} n_i dS.
\label{dcoFVForm}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Local or Projected DCO Diffusive Flux Coefficient}
While the DCO kernel is certainly at subcontrol surfaces, the evaluation of $\nu$ can be computed by a multitude of
approaches. For example, the artificial diffusive flux coefficient can be computed locally (with local residuals and local metric tensors)
or can be projected to the nodes (via an $L_{oo}$ or $L_2$ projection) and re-interpolated to the gauss points. The former results 
in a sharper local value while the later results in a more filtered-like value.

\subsection{Approaches for near-zero gradients}
The denominator in the $\nu$ expression can approach zero in regions of the flow that are uniform. In practice, the DCO approach
is highly sensitive to the numerical ``small'' limit that must be added to avoid a divide-by-zero. Values of ``small'' $too$ small
result in stiff linear solves while values $too$ large result in conflicts in the correct order of the gradient term. Efforts
are still underway to determine a more appropriate approach.

\subsection{General Findings}
In general, the DCO approach seems to work well for a canonical uniform flow through which a passive scalar advects and diffuses.
Sensitivity to the denominator (as noted above) are found. In a helium plume, the above form results in an excessively diffuse
plume, while no monotonitciy issues are noted. The findings apply to both low order and higher order CVFEM schemes.
